    "If we collect N samples for one dimensional data, then we know that using mean and variance we can get a good perspective on data. In short, using sufficient statistics i.e mean and variance allows us to have compression and remove the noise. The natural question is what to do when we have more than one dimensions to data i.e say M dimensions. Well how about characterizing it by M mean and M variances? This seems intuitively right, but here we are assuming that there is no relation between any two dimensions. What if we want to account for this?

    "In many MLE problem, we can't exactly find the closed form solution and we have to perform iterative methods.\n",
    "EM is one of those iterative methods.\n",

    "Let's go back to our favorite dice examples. Let's assume two biased dices with random variable $D_A$ and $D_B$ and we would like to find probability mass function (i.e probability for each of the outcomes).\n",

    "As we explained in section 3.3.3, we can just use the frequency counting to have the MLE of probability mass function. In words, we can roll each dice many times and \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets add a twist i.e we are given the outcome and we don't know whether it was generated from dice $D_A$ or $D_B$. How can we find the MLE probability mass function? Well since we don't know which dice generated our outcome, the best we can assume that a outcome can be generated from either of dices. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, given an unknown die (singular of dice), we just roll it many times and estimate the posterior probability of each realization, using Bayes Theorem (see section PT.4). This will act as the weights of the original samples. This step is called **Expectation Step (E-Step)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, given our weights on data, we again compute the MLE estimate of the data using frequency count. But this time, instead of using the original frequency, we use the weighted frequency . The weights being the posterior computed from  (E-step). This is called **Maximization Step(M-Step)**. Since in the maximization step, we used our better guess, it is a better estimate of the actual probability. \n",
